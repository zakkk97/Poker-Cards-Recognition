# GA Card Recognition
This project implements a card recognition system using genetic algorithms 
and image processing techniques. The system processes images of playing cards 
to identify their values and suits.

## Features
- Recognition of playing cards based on visual features.
- Implementation in Python with OpenCV and Genetic Algorithms.

## For the installation write in the terminal
pip install -r requirements.txt
